# Project Overview 

- in this lab, we first cloned our repository, shared it with each other, then added the initial contents that we were given, then we comitted and pushed them to GitHub 

-  in exercise B we wrote CSS code to make a webpage layout responsive. we needed to update our webpage with fluid images, menu styling, gap management, and visual debugging. we worked with box-sizing, display, width, etc. 

- in exercise C, we wrote CSS code to make a responsive webpage layout using the Flex technique. again, we needed to implement a responsive layout, fluid images, menu styling, gap managment, and visual debugging.
